# A* Search Algorithm with C++

- random_board_generator.py will generate a random board based on the number of rows, columns, and difficulty level passed as an argument.
- main.cpp will read the board generated by the script and returns the path based on A* Search Algorithm.

- Symbols used:

  - Obstacles -> ⛰️
  - Path -> 🚗
  - Empty Path -> E
  - Closed Path -> C
  - Starting Point -> 🚦
  - Finishing Point -> 🏁
